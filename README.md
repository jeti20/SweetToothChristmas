# SweetToothChristmas

A game of collecting candy canes and escaping/fighting snowballs that grow over time. The aim of the game is to reach as many enemies as possible. Each new wave is +1 enemy and a new candy cane.

Bugs to fix:
* TheHighestScore is overwritten when you reach the second wave of enemies
* the candy cane gives a buff to fight enemies, but after collecting the second candy cane during the buff, the time does not increase

Things I can add:
* marking the duration of the buff visable for the player
